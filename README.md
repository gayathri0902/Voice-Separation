# Voice-Separation
Our model began to predict the output with better accuracy after going through training and experimentation. This model is successful in speech enhancement, voice separation and text generation.
• Enhancer :
This model succeeded in enhancing the speech that separates the noise from the input mixed
audio signal and the SNR(Speech to Noise Ratio) score of the audio signal is generated which
measures the score of noise present in the audio signal We began to see positive values of
SNR values of the enhanced audio signals which shows that the speech enhancing is done
efficiently
• Voice separation :
The model succeeded in separating voice of multiple speakers to separate individual speakers
and generates the SDR(Signal to Distortion Ratio) scores which measures the quality of the
audio signal We began to see more positive SDR values to the separated signals which shows
that the quality of the separated audio signal is better
• Speech to text generation :
Text is generated from the separated speeches of the mixed audio signal, predicted by the
model. We began to observe that upon using a pretrained model for text generation like Deep
learning-based approaches, such as those provided by ESPNet, have shown significant improvements over traditional techniques and have achieved state-of-the-art results on various
benchmark datasets.
